# studious-journey

In this repository, I store the sites I replicate to train front-end skills. If you have any suggestions to improve my projects or skills, please contact me =)

Every directory is a diferent replic of an site. Inside of any directory we will see the .html file(s) and the css file(s), in addition to a folder /images, containing the images used in the project. Any other file or directory created in the projects will be explained, if necessary.
